/**
 * JIT-Optimize loop runner.
 *
 * Orchestrates the multi-round optimization flow:
 *   - resolve task source into train + test sets (unless log source)
 *   - run both sets per round, collect evidence
 *   - call the optimizer with TRAIN evidence only (test stays held out)
 *   - snapshot the result into a proposal round
 *   - repeat until rounds/convergence
 *   - pick best round by test score (fallback: train score)
 *   - optionally auto-apply best round to the original skill folder
 *
 * The optimizer is agent-based; the concrete backend is chosen via
 * core/headless-agent.ts.

/**
 * Pick the best round with baseline protection, noise tolerance, per-task
 * monotonicity, and convergence short-circuit.
 *
 * Ordering of guards (first hit wins):
 *  1. **Convergence short-circuit.** If round 0's primary ≥
 *     `convergenceThreshold`, return round 0 unconditionally. This matches
 *     the `alreadyConverged` check that already skips optimization entirely
 *     — selection must agree or a mid-session regression could displace a
 *     baseline the engine never tried to improve.
 *  2. **Baseline gate.** Drop any non-baseline round whose primary does not
 *     exceed `round0.primary + minImprovement`. Rationale: at runsPerTask=1
 *     / N=2 the empirical score std is 0.03–0.08, so a floating-point-sized
 *     win is indistinguishable from noise. If the baseline gate empties the
 *     candidate pool, return round 0.
 *  3. **Per-task monotonicity gate (Layer 2).** For each round that cleared
 *     the baseline gate, walk round 0's task set and compare each task
 *     against the candidate's `perTaskTestScores` (or `perTaskTrainScores`
 *     when there is no separate test set). A task is excluded when either
 *     it dropped by more than `perTaskRegressionTolerance`, OR the
 *     candidate has no clean runs for it at all (maximum uncertainty,
 *     conservative rejection). Tasks new in the candidate but absent from
 *     round 0 are ignored — synthetic regen is allowed to introduce tasks
 *     without triggering the gate. A higher aggregate primary does not
 *     buy the right to tank a specific task.
 *  4. **Epsilon-aware sort.** Within the surviving pool, compare primary
 *     scores. Differences under `SELECTION_EPSILON` are treated as ties and
 *     defer directly to round-number ascending — prefer the round closer to
 *     baseline so a no-op rerun cannot displace round 0.
 *  5. Final tiebreaks (rarely reached): train-score when comparable, then
 *     target-agent tokens, then duration.
 *
 * Weak-monotonicity note: when `hasTest` is false, the per-task gate runs
 * on the training set — i.e., the exact tasks the optimizer was reading
 * evidence from. This is weaker protection than a true holdout but still
 * catches catastrophic per-task collapses (task A went from 1.0 to 0.3
 * while task B went from 0.5 to 1.0 and the mean ticked up). Users who
 * want the strong version pass `--test-tasks` so `hasTest=true`.
